# File Watcher Mover

This project monitors one or more directories and automatically moves newly created or renamed files to other directories based on their extensions. Ideal for organizing downloads, images, videos, and other types of files automatically.

![Application Flow example](./assets/app-flow-example.png)

## Features

- Monitors multiple directories simultaneously.
- Moves files to target folders based on their extension.
- Supports custom extensions via configuration file.
- Compatible with Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## How It Works

The system uses the [watchdog](https://pypi.org/project/watchdog/) library to observe file creation and movement events. When it detects a new file or a change in extension (e.g., a file is created as '.tmp' and renamed to '.mp4'), it checks the configuration and moves the file to the corresponding directory.

## Configuration
> [!IMPORTANT]\
> Always keep the `config.json` file in the same directory as `main.py` or the generated `.exe`.  
> Make sure the `config.json` is filled with valid directory paths for both the `"targets"` and `"extension"` fields.  
> Example:
> ```json
> {
>   "targets": [
>     "C:\\Users\\your_user\\Downloads"
>   ],
>   "extension": {
>     ".pdf": "C:\\Users\\your_user\\Documents\\pdf"
>   }
> }
> ```

There are no limitations â€” configure any file extension and as many target directories as you want.

Edit the `config.json` file to define the monitored directories and the destinations for each extension:



- **targets**: List of directories to be monitored.
- **extensions**: Mapping of extensions to destination directories.

<details>
  <summary><h4>Executable</h4></summary>

  Go to the [releases page](https://github.com/mtpontes/file-watcher-mover/releases), download the `file-watcher-mover.zip`, extract the zip file to the final directory where you want to keep the application, and run the executable.

#### Installation
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/mtpontes/file-watcher-mover.git
   cd file-mover
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```sh
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate   # On Windows
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run:**
```sh
python main.py
```
The program will stay running, monitoring the defined directories. To stop it, press `Ctrl+C`.

  <summary><h2>Windows Service</h2></summary>

This is the approach I recommend the most, I created this app precisely with the intention of using it as a Windows service.

<!-- ### Build
#### Prerequisites
- Pyinstaller

```sh
pyinstaller --onefile main.py
``` -->

<!-- **Build together with the configuration file:**
```sh
pyinstaller --onefile --add-data "config.json;." main.py
``` -->

### Resource allocation
The process consumes only 1.5MB of RAM, CPU consumption is also irrelevant, while no event is triggered, the CPU remains at 0% usage, when an event is triggered it does not even reach 1% (Ryzen 7 5800X) usage, in addition to the processing occurring fast enough that you don't even notice it happened.

### Prerequisites
- NSSM CLI

### Turning into a service
```sh
nssm install <service_name> "C:\example\absolute\path\file-watcher-mover.exe"
```

#### Start service
You can either use an NSSM command, or do this manually via the native Windows CLI or via the Services interface.

Examples:
```sh
# Native
net start <service_name>
```

```sh
nssm start <service_name>
```


The `.exe` is linked to the service; to manage it, you need to stop and remove the service.

> **NOTE**  
> For more information about NSSM commands, troubleshooting with PyInstaller, and other advanced usage, please refer to the official documentation of each tool.
